# Simplex-Algorithm

##Introduction##
<p> In this project we used Simplex Algorithm to solve the famous Brewery Problem.</p>
<p> Brewery problem is about a small brewery that produces Ale and Beer. 
Production of ale and beer is limited by scarce (limited) resources: corn, hops, malt.
Recipes for ale and beer require different proportions of resources. 
So we need to find the mix of quantities of the products Ale and Beer to be produced in such a way that the
profit obtained is maximum.</p>

##Steps involved in Simplex Algorithm##
1.	Convert the standard from to normal for by adding slack variables.
2.	Find the initial Basic Feasible Solution.
3.	Check the equations for optimality 
4.	Find the pivot point to find better BFS
5.	Repeat above process until equations are optimal.
